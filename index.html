     <h1>Have you ever made a pizza from scratch?</h1>
     <h2>Yeah, but have you really thought about it?</h2>
     <h3>Like, how if you put the sauce on first, before you make the base it doesn't work?</h3>
     <h4>Or, if you put the cheese on then the sauce it's messed up too</h4>

<!-- Add some copy here -->
    <p>Making a pizza is similar to coding. There are 
    certain things we have to do first. Like making the base,
    letting it rise, mould the base out, add the sauce, add the
    toppings, add the cheese, bake, and cut and serve. Not all
    pizzas end up the same, but they do start out in the same way
    as long as you follow the order correctly. You can have
    everything you need to make many different pizzas using the same
    base structure that is set up before hand. </p>
